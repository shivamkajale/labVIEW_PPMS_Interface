LabVIEW Interface for Quantum Design PPMS
Hello! In this repository, you'll find a LabVIEW-based program I designed to automate the control of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) and its associated external electronics. I created it to help users execute complex, long-duration measurement sequences through a simple scripting interface, ensuring precise and repeatable data acquisition.

Overview
From my experience, automating experiments that run for many hours or even days can be challenging. I developed this interface to address this need by providing a robust framework for scripting measurement sequences. My program works by reading a predefined script that dictates the state of the PPMS (like temperature and magnetic field) and then triggers measurements from external instruments at specified points.

This approach allows for unattended operation, which I hope will free up your valuable research time and improve the consistency of your collected data.

Key Features
Script-Based Automation: I designed the system so you can define entire measurement sequences in a simple text file.

PPMS Control: The software gives you full control over the PPMS temperature and magnetic field.

External Instrument Integration: I've built it to seamlessly interface with external electronics such as Keithley source-meters and multimeters for complex measurements.

Versatile Measurements: It's ideal for a wide range of experiments, including:

I-V (Current-Voltage) sweeps

Magneto-transport studies

AC/DC measurements

Reliability: I designed the program to be stable for long-duration experiments running over extended periods.

How It Works
The core of my program is a script interpreter that reads a sequence file you define. Each line in the script corresponds to a specific action or state change. The LabVIEW program I wrote parses this file and sends the appropriate commands to the PPMS and other connected instruments in the correct order.

This approach allows you to easily modify experimental parameters without needing to alter the LabVIEW code itself.
